Predicting the outcome of the 2017 College Football bowl games

Just how well can we predict the outcome of college football bowl games this year without the use of advanced metrics?  Using the results of every FBS regular season game this year, this is an attempt to predict the results of every college football bowl game for the 2017-2018 season.  In one regard, college football is somewhat unique among major sports (college level or professional); the challenge in quantifying just how good teams are in college football is that the number of games each team plays compared to the number of teams in the division provides us with a very small sample size to work with.  Each team will play only 10% of all other teams against whom they will be compared to, so just how well can common machine learning algorithms sort through the pile to determine who will beat who on any given Saturday?
